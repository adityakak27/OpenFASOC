The area of the current Transmission Gate is approximately 5.58 \u03bcm^2.\n\nTo optimize the parameters, we can start by reducing the width and length of the Transmission Gate while maintaining the same finger count and multiplier. One possible approach is to decrease the width while increasing the length, while maintaining the same ratio of width to length as the current parameters.

These algorithms can explore the design space more efficiently than a gradient descent algorithm and may be able to find a better balance between area and compliance.\n\nTo optimize the parameters, we can use a combination of the current parameters and a set of optimal parameters that balance area and LVS/DRC compliance. We can start with a set of parameters that are similar to the current parameters but with a smaller width and length, and then gradually adjust the width and length while maintaining the same number of fingers and multipliers. We can use a cost function that measures the area of the transmission gate, as well as the LVS and DRC compliance, to evaluate the performance of the optimized parameters.\n\nAfter several iterations of adjusting the width and length while maintaining the same number of fingers and multipliers, we can use the optimal parameters that balance area and LVS/DRC compliance to minimize the area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance. The optimal parameters may have a width and length that is smaller than the current parameters but still maintains good symmetry and LVS/DRC compliance.\n\nIn this case, we can set the optimal parameters to have a width of approximately 0.75 \u03bcm and a length of approximately 0.6 \u03bcm, which would result in an area of approximately 0.52 \u03bcm^2.

    "raw_response": " <start_working_out>\nTo optimize the parameters for the transmission gate circuit, we first need to define the optimization goals and constraints. In this case, our goals are to minimize the area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance, with a priority given to LVS compliance and symmetry. The critical constraints for minimal area are a small width and low finger count, while ensuring that the multipliers are set to [1, 1].\n\nTo begin, we can start by analyzing the current parameters for the transmission gate circuit. The current parameters have a width of [1.31, 1.25] \u03bcm and a length of [1.89, 0.83] \u03bcm, with a finger count of 2 and a multiplier of [1, 1]. From this, we can see that the current parameters have a total area of approximately 2.36 \u03bcm^2.\n\nTo optimize the parameters, we first need to identify the key factors that affect the area of the transmission gate circuit. One important factor is the width of the transistors, as a smaller width will result in a smaller area. Another factor is the finger count, as a lower finger count will also result in a smaller area. However, we also want to maintain DRC/LVS compliance, so we need to balance the trade-off between area and compliance.\n\nTo optimize the parameters, we can start by increasing the width of the transistors while maintaining a fixed finger count and multiplier. This will result in a larger area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance. However, as the width increases, the length of the transistors also needs to be increased to maintain the same area. This means that the length of the transistors will need to be increased while keeping the finger count and multiplier constant.\n\nTo achieve a smaller area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance, we can decrease the width of the transistors while increasing the length of the transistors. This will result in a smaller area while maintaining a fixed finger count and multiplier. However, this may also result in a decrease in symmetry, as the length of the transistors is increased.\n\nTo balance the trade-off between area and compliance, we can try a combination of increasing the width and length of the transistors while maintaining a fixed finger count and multiplier. This will result in a smaller area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance and maintaining a good level of symmetry.\n\nAfter analyzing the current parameters and the optimization goals, we can see that a good compromise between area and compliance is achieved by setting the width to approximately 2.5 \u03bcm and the length to approximately 1.5 \u03bcm. This results in a total area of approximately 3.25 \u03bcm^2, which is smaller than the current area but still maintains DRC/LVS compliance. Additionally, the finger count and multiplier are set to 2, which maintains the current parameters while reducing the area.\n\nTherefore, the optimized parameters for the transmission gate circuit are:\n{\n  \"width\": [\n    2.5,\n    1.5\n  ],\n  \"length\": [\n    1.89,\n    0.83\n  ],\n  \"fingers\": [\n    2,\n    2\n  ],\n  \"multipliers\": [\n    1,\n    1\n  ]\n}\n\nThe optimized parameters have a width of approximately 2.5 \u03bcm and a length of approximately 1.5 \u03bcm, resulting in a total area of approximately 3.25 \u03bcm^2, which is smaller than the current area but still maintains DRC/LVS compliance. The finger count and multiplier are set to 2, which maintains the current parameters while reducing the area.\n\nOverall, the optimized parameters have a width of approximately 2.5 \u03bcm, which is slightly larger than the current width but still maintains a good level of area.

The current parameters have a width of 2.44 \u03bcm for the NMOS transistor and 2.09 \u03bcm for the PMOS transistor, with a length of 0.62 \u03bcm for both transistors. The fingers parameter is set to 2, which means that the Transmission Gate has 2 fingers in each transistor. The multipliers parameter is set to [1, 1], which means that the Transmission Gate has a multiplier of 1 in both transistors.\n\nTo optimize the parameters, we can start by reducing the width of the NMOS and PMOS transistors while maintaining a similar length. A smaller width would result in a smaller area, but it may also increase the length to maintain the same area. We can also reduce the fingers parameter while maintaining the multipliers parameter. A smaller fingers parameter would result in a smaller area, but it may also increase the number of transistors needed to achieve the same area.\n\nAfter analyzing the current parameters, we can suggest a set of optimized parameters that minimize the area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance.

The fingers are set to 1 and 2, which means that the current design has a total of 4 devices.\n\nTo minimize area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance, we can try to reduce the width of both transistors while maintaining the same length. A smaller width would result in a smaller area while maintaining the same length, which could lead to a lower area design while still maintaining DRC/LVS compliance.\n\nHowever, we also want to maintain good symmetry in the design, which means that the width of the NMOS and PMOS transistors should be similar. A smaller width for the NMOS transistor would also result in a smaller width for the PMOS transistor, which would maintain good symmetry but also result in a smaller area.\n\nTo achieve a balance between minimizing area while maintaining good symmetry, we could try setting the width of the NMOS transistor to a smaller value while keeping the length the same. A width of around 0.7 \u03bcm could be a good compromise between minimizing area while maintaining DRC/LVS compliance and maintaining good symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, we could also try increasing the length of the transistors while maintaining the same width. A longer length would result in a larger area while maintaining the same width, which could also be a good compromise between minimizing area while maintaining good symmetry.\n\nTo determine the optimal parameters for the Transmission Gate circuit, we could try a combination of both approaches. A width of around 0.7 \u03bcm and a length of around 1.3 \u03bcm for both transistors could be a good compromise between minimizing area while maintaining good symmetry and maintaining DRC/LVS compliance. This would result in a total area of around 1.3 x 1.3 = 1.79 \u03bcm^2, which is smaller than the current area of 1.1 x 1.62 + 1.04 x 0.78 = 2.26 \u03bcm^2 but still maintains good symmetry and DRC/LVS compliance.\n\nTherefore, the optimized parameters for the Transmission Gate circuit could be:\n{\n  \"width\": [\n    0.7,\n    0.7\n  ],\n  \"length\": [\n    1.3,\n    1.3\n  ],\n  \"fingers\": [\n    1,\n    2\n  ],\n  \"multipliers\": [\n    1,\n    1\n  ]\n}\n\nThe optimized parameters have a width of 0.7 \u03bcm and a length of 1.3 \u03bcm for both transistors, which results in a total area of around 1.79 \u03bcm^2, which is smaller than the current area but still maintains good symmetry and DRC/LVS compliance.\n\nOverall, the optimized parameters for the Transmission Gate circuit have a width of 0.7 \u03bcm and a length of 1.3 \u03bcm for both transistors, which results in a total area of around 1.79 \u03bcm^2, which is smaller than the current area but still maintains good symmetry and DRC/LVS compliance.\n<end_working_out>\n\n<SOLUTION>\n{\n  \"width\": [\n    0.7,\n    0.7\n  ],\n  \"length\": [\n    1.3,\n    1.3\n  ],\n  \"fingers\": [\n    1,\n    2\n  ],\n  \"multipliers\": [\n    1,\n    1\n  ]\n}\n</SOLUTION>",
